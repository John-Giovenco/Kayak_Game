Whack an Alien!

Description -
Here, we have an interactive gamae paying tribute to the classic arcade game, Whack-A-Mole! I just thought we would should give it a different theme in order to add a new look.

The game features 9 meteors floating in space in which our friendly (or maybe not so friendly) aliens will then pop out. Your job is to Whack (or click) on the aliens before they go back behind their meteors. Your better be quick because they move fast and you only have 15 seconds to rack up your score! Click start to begin the timer and don't forgot... you need to be fast!

Technologies used -
The Technologies used to create the app were HTML and CSS for the structure and styling. Javascript was then used for the functionality.

Technical Requirements -
Since this is strictly a client side application, there aren't any instalations needed besides the live server extension. Simply fork the repository using this link https://github.com/John-Giovenco/Kayak_Game.git and then open with live server to begin playing.

Issues and upcoming changes -
Will look to add a score board in the future so we can acknowledge the best players.

Changelog -
Looking to add Scoreboard in the next version coming out later this month.
